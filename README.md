# Composite Numbers
MASM Assembly program to calculate and display composite numbers. Uses the Kip Irvine library for x86 processors.

## Objectives
1. Using register indirect addressing.
2. Passing parameters.
3. Generating "random" numbers.
4. Working with arrays.

- First, the user is instructed to enter the number of composites to be displayed, and is prompted to enter an integer in the range of 1 to 400. 
- When the user enters a number, n, the program verifies that 0 < n < 401. 
- If n is out of range, the user is re-prompted until s/he enters a value in the specified range. 
- Then the program then calculates and displays all of the composite numbers up to and including the n-th composite. 
- Finally the results are displayed 10 composites per line with at least 3 spaces between the numbers.
